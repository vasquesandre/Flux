# Flux

Flux is a simple and organized **to-do list app** built using **Swift** and **UIKit**, with data persistence powered by **Core Data**. Users can create multiple categories and add tasks under each one.

This app is part of my learning journey through the [iOS & Swift - The Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp] by **Angela Yu** on **Udemy**.
